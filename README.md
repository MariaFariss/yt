# ytDjango
This project is done by Django. Django is a framework web based on python, it is known for it is known for its benefits such as handling a large amount of traffic, protecting against errors, his high level of security, and his huge number of features... . Inorder to create a project, we should do some initial steup. From the command line we need to cd in the directory where we woant to store the code then run this command : django-admin startproject mysite , and then this is what is created : mysite/ manage.py mysite/ init.py settings.py urls.py asgi.py wsgi.py mysite/ is the container of the project we can name what ever we want (it's the root directory). manage.py : help us to interact with django (a command line utility) for the other mysite/ is the python container directory for the project and what matter the most for us is in this directory there are two files where the changes are made : settings.py and urls.py. Because after creating an app we add it to settings.py in "INSTALLED_APP" and add the name in "DIRS", then add the url in urls.py (which is the url declarations for django). When we want to run the server we need to write the command: python manage.py runserver. If we want to build an app we need to write in command line : python manage.py startapp.
